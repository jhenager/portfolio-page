      <p>My name is <span style="color:rgb(16, 88, 64)">James Henager</span> and I am a software developer from Phoenix, Arizona. Currently I live in Portland, Oregon where I am pursuing a certificate in web and mobile development at Epicodus.

      <h2 id="title"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
      <p>I gained my first project management experience as the Event Coordinator for the Student Government at Portland Community College: Cascade. This experience opened new doors for me in the restaurant industry, where I first began as a dishwasher in 2013. In 2019 I was hired at busy downtown Portland restaurant LeChon, as the Private Event Coordinator. Many of my clients in the tech industry encouraged me to learn how to code, which is how I came to enroll at Epicodus!

      <h2 id="title"><strong>Interests</strong></h2>
      <p>I have had a great fondness for technology ever since I received my first Gameboy as a kid. Videogames are a love of mine, and I enjoy collecting both retro and modern games. Seeing live music is another of my favorite activities! Japan has always greatly interested me as well, and I was fortunate enough to finally visit in 2019!
